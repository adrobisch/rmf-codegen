    To obtain an access token for an Anonymous Session, the OAuth client needs the create_anonymous_token scope.
    The regular Client Credentials Flow is used.

    These access tokens are similar to those issued with the Password Flow, but they are not associated with a
    customer but with an anonymousId. In addition to the access token, a refresh token is issued. The refresh
    token is the only way to get a new access token for this particular anonymousId.

    The anonymousId is either generated by the API or an unused id may be supplied with the optional parameter
    anonymous_id.
